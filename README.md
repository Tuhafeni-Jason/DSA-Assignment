# Phonebook Application

## Project Overview
This project is a mobile phonebook application implemented using Java and SQL for persistent storage. Contacts are temporarily stored in an `ArrayList`, and operations such as inserting, searching, deleting, and updating contacts are supported.

## Features
- Insert contact
- Search contact
- Display all contacts
- Delete contact
- Update contact
- Sort contacts (optional)
- Sync between ArrayList and SQL database

## Data Structure
We used an `ArrayList` for contact storage and synchronization with a MySQL database for long-term storage.

## SQL Integration
The application uses SQL to permanently store contacts. The database structure includes a `Contacts` table with fields for contact name and phone number.
