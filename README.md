Phonebook Application
Project Overview

This project is a Phonebook Application implemented in Java using an ArrayList as the underlying data structure. The application allows users to perform basic phonebook operations such as inserting, searching, deleting, updating, and sorting contacts.

Pseudocode and Flowchart

The pseudocode and flowchart to this assignment can be found in the phonebook.pdf document.

Features

    Insert Contact:
        Allows users to add a new contact to the phonebook.
    Search Contact:
        Allows users to search for a contact by name and view the associated phone number.
    Display All Contacts:
        Displays all contacts stored in the phonebook.
    Delete Contact:
        Removes a contact by name from the phonebook.
    Update Contact:
        Updates the phone number of an existing contact.
    Sort Contacts (Optional):

Time Complexity:

    Insert: O(1) – Contacts are appended to the ArrayList.
    Search, Delete, Update: O(n) – A linear search is performed to find a contact.
    Sort: O(n log n) – Sorting uses Java's built-in sorting algorithm.
